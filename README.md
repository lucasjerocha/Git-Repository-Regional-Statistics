# Git Repository: Regional Statistics of Developers and Repositories

This repository explores and visualizes data related to GitHub activities across different regions and countries. The dataset includes counts of pushers, developers, and repositories, categorized by geographic regions. The analysis also includes specific insights such as pushes by developers, pushes by repositories, usage of R for pushes, and usage of Julia by pushers.

## Dataset
